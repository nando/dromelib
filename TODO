Everything!!! :)

But for now it will be very apreciated if someone help me to remove this
offenses to the RoboCop:

lib/dromelib/gmail.rb:12:5: C: Use module_function instead of extend self.
    extend self
    ^^^^^^^^^^^
lib/dromelib/config.rb:9:5: C: Use module_function instead of extend self.
    extend self
    ^^^^^^^^^^^

14 files inspected, 2 offenses detected
RuboCop failed!

I've implemented Dromelib::Config as a singleton object in a module as Gregory
Brown says in its awesome Uses for Modules series[0]

Thanks in advance!
